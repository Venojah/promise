# Project Team Collaboration Guidelines

Welcome to the project! This document outlines how our team collaborates, communicates, and manages tasks.  

## Team Meetings

- **Weekly Team Calls:** Every **Wednesday**, we hold a team call to discuss progress, blockers, and plans for the week.  
- **Bi-Weekly Project Owner Calls:** Every **2 weeks**, we meet with the project owner to provide updates and receive feedback.  
- **Spontaneous Calls:** If urgent issues or blockers arise, we may schedule ad-hoc calls to resolve them quickly.  

## Task Management

- **Working with Issues:** All tasks, bugs, and feature requests are tracked via our issue tracker.  
- **Assignments:** Team members are assigned tasks based on priorities and expertise. Everyone is responsible for updating their progress regularly.  

## Collaboration Guidelines

- **Flexibility:** While we have scheduled meetings and assignments, flexibility is key. Team members are encouraged to communicate proactively if they need support or adjustments in their workload.  
- **Communication:** Use our primary communication channels (Teams and Whatsapp) to ask questions, share updates, and discuss blockers.
